It takes various time to process and update tables for different daily data, which means it's possible that the database is not available.(Tick level data is not ready right after 15:30, and those tables under process can not be used through \a or select command).

## .Q.view(subview)

Instead of asking for <font color='blue'>all</font> historical data, .Q.view enable us to set a time restriction on all the partitioned or segmented tables.

To set the range of partitions can be visited:
```q
.Q.view date where date < 2020.01.01
```

To reset to all partition:
```q
.Q.view[]
```
