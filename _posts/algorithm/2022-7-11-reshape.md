reshape a matrix is easy in q.

## Matrix 

```q
sample:1+til 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
This is a list range from 1 to 9. To form a N*M matrix from it, use the following syntax:

```q
m1:3 3#sample
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

if N*M is bigger than the lenof list, then the whole list will auto fillup in a rotating order.

```q
m2:3 4#sample
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 1 2 3
```

if N*M is smaller than the lenof list, then the matrix will be formed on the subset of the list

```q
m3:3 2#sample
1 2
3 4
5 6
```

## Table
To have a better understanding of *Table* check Note:Dict and Tables

```q
T:([] sym:10?`a`b;k1:10?(0b;1b);k2:10?`t`f;v1:10#1+til 10;v2:1+til 10)
sym k1 k2 v1 v2
---------------
b   0  t  1  1
b   1  t  2  2
a   1  t  3  3
b   0  f  4  4
a   0  t  5  5
b   1  f  6  6
a   0  t  7  7
b   1  f  8  8
a   0  t  9  9
b   0  f  10 10
```

### Several cols to one col
Take the table above for example, now it has two value col:v1 and v2. 

v1 is the current value, and v2 is the future value. Now it's logical to have it in one row.  What if we suppose to add one col indicating the predicted period.

That's expecting the table to be:
```q
sym k1 k2 k3   v 
-----------------
b   0  t  2022 1
b   0  t  2023 1
b   1  t  2022 2
b   1  t  2023 2
a   1  t  2022 3
a   1  t  2023 3
b   0  f  2022 4
b   0  f  2023 4
a   0  t  2022 5
a   0  t  2023 5
b   1  f  2022 6
b   1  f  2023 6
a   0  t  2022 7
a   0  t  2023 7
b   1  f  2022 8
b   1  f  2023 8
a   0  t  2022 9
a   0  t  2023 9
b   0  f  2022 10
b   0  f  2023 10
```
**Solution :**

In this case, the name of cols to be merged into one is Input. For simplicity, we can hardcode the merging process into "select" method:
```
update v:flip(v1;v2) from T
```
Now we need to add the new key column, suppose current time is 2022. Then we may use:
```
update k3:(count[T]#2022)+\:til 2 from T
```
Finally, apply ```ungroup``` on the table.
