The groupby is built-in for q.

## pandas method
The self-define function apply on pandas groupby object is operating on a small dataframe rather than specified column.
```python
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Animal':['Falcon','Falcon','Parrot','Parrot'],
    'Max Speed':[300,200,400,500],
    'Min Speed':[100,100,200,300]
})
```
After groupby(), a groupby object is generated.

```
list(df.groupby('Animal'))

[('Falcon',    
    Animal  Max Speed  Min Speed
    0  Falcon        300        100
    1  Falcon        200        100), 
('Parrot',    
    Animal  Max Speed  Min Speed
    2  Parrot        400        200
    3  Parrot        500        300)]
```

Suppose we need to get the sum of two column groupby sym,(in this case, get mean,sum or delta of max_speed and min_speed by animal)
```python
df.groupby('Animal').apply(lambda x:pd.Series({
                "max_min mean":(x['Max Speed']+x['Min Speed']).mean()
                }))
```
So the lambda input is the sub dataframe. 

## q method
```q
t:([] sym:4#`a`b;val1:4#1+til 10;val2:4#2+til 10);
```
The q method groupby is called directly and applied on column. 

For example,
```q
update val3:val1*2 by sym from t

sym val1 val2 val3
------------------
a   1    2    2
b   2    3    4
a   3    4    6
b   4    5    8
```
### Aggregate
!!*Attention* check the row number
```q
update val3:avg val1+val2 by sym from t

sym val1 val2 val3
------------------
a   1    2    5
b   2    3    7
a   3    4    5
b   4    5    7
```
VS

```q
0!select val3:avg val1+val2 by sym from t

sym val3
--------
a   5
b   7
```
The row number *differs* a lot. The result of <font color=blue>select</font> query is much more like the pandas groupby, where the key number will be the same as the group *set* of grouped pairs.

THUS, as long as the column you groupby with is <font color=red>with duplicates</font>, use select rather than update.
