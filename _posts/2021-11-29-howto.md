## pages


The simplest method to create page is to add certain html(md) file under the root directory. 

The path of the file determines the associated URL.
```
.
├── about.md    # => http://example.com/about.html
├── index.html    # => http://example.com/
└── contact.html  # => http://example.com/contact.html
```
Complicated structure like subfolder is also supported. 
```
.
├── about.md          # => http://example.com/about.html
├── documentation     # folder containing pages
│   └── doc1.md       # => http://example.com/documentation/doc1.html
├── design            # folder containing pages
│   └── draft.md      # => http://example.com/design/draft.html
```

## Posts

"The _posts folder is where your blog posts live. You typically write posts in Markdown, HTML is also supported."

To create a post, file need to follow the following format:
```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
```

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

```
2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md
```
